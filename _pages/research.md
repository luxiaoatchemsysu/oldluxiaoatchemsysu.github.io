[1] Regional ozone air quality
======
**Surface ozone air quality over China.** Our analyses reveal that China has become a global hotspot of surface ozone pollution, with the summertime ozone air quality metrics, human health metrics, and vegetation exposure metrics significantly higher in China compared to other industrialized regions (Japan, South Korea, Europe, and US). [ES&T Letters, 2018] [News report], and shows the fastest ozone increases compared with the urban ozone trends in any other region worldwide reported in the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) [ES&T Letters, 2020]. We use high-resolution GEOS-Chem simulations to quantify the natural and anthropogenic sources contributing to surface ozone over China in 2016-2017, and attribute the ozone increases in 2017 to higher background ozone driven by the hotter and drier weather conditions  [ACP, 2019].

**Wildfire influences on the variability and trend of summer surface ozone in the mountainous western United States.** We develop a new method to estimate wildfire ozone enhancement over the western US during 1989-2010 based on backward trajectory model and statistical model. The figure shows that wildfire has a large impact on the number of high ozone episodes (MDA8 > 70 ppbv) over the 13 CASTNet sites in the western US. We also explore the possible limitation of Eulerian chemical transport models (e.g. GEOS-Chem) on wildfire chemistry simulation. [ACP, 2016]
